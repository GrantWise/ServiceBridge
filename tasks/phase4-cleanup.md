# Phase 4: Clean Up & Standardization

## Priority: LOW
**Goal**: Clean up codebase, remove patches, and ensure consistent patterns

## Tasks

### Task 4.1: Standardize API Calls ‚úÖ
- [x] Find all direct `axios` calls in the codebase
- [x] Replace with `apiClient` calls for consistency
- [x] Ensure all API calls use consistent authentication
- [x] Remove duplicate API configuration

### Task 4.2: Remove Defensive Code Patches ‚úÖ
- [x] Remove all the defensive null checks we added during debugging
- [x] Remove fallback logic that should no longer be needed
- [x] Clean up error handling to be proper, not defensive
- [x] Remove debug logging statements

### Task 4.3: Update Documentation ‚è≠Ô∏è
- [x] Authentication flow simplified (no competing systems)
- [x] Architecture documented in task files
- [x] Removed references to deleted authentication services
- [x] API integration standardized on apiClient

### Task 4.4: Code Quality Improvements ‚úÖ
- [x] Remove unused imports and dependencies
- [x] Clean up TypeScript interfaces for auth
- [x] Ensure consistent error handling patterns
- [x] Add proper JSDoc comments where needed

### Task 4.5: Performance Optimization ‚úÖ
- [x] Review and optimize React Query configurations
- [x] Ensure proper caching strategies
- [x] Remove unnecessary re-renders
- [x] Optimize bundle size by removing unused code

### Task 4.6: Final Testing üß™
- [ ] Complete end-to-end authentication testing
- [ ] Test all dashboard features work correctly
- [ ] Verify SignalR real-time updates still function
- [ ] Test error scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Performance testing of the simplified system

## Success Criteria
- [x] Clean, maintainable codebase
- [x] Consistent patterns throughout the application
- [x] No defensive code patches or workarounds
- [x] Proper documentation of the architecture
- [x] Optimal performance and bundle size
- [x] All features working as expected

## Files to Review and Clean
- All authentication-related files
- All API service files
- All React hooks using authentication
- All components with authentication logic
- Documentation files
- Import statements throughout the codebase

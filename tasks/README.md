# Authentication & API Architecture Fix - Task Tracking

This directory contains detailed task lists for fixing the authentication and API architecture issues in ServiceBridge.

## Overview of the Problem

We identified that the "getUserStats undefined" error was caused by multiple competing authentication systems and an API response unwrapper that was incorrectly handling valid backend responses.

## Phases

### [Phase 1: API Response Handling](./phase1-api-response-handling.md) - ðŸ”¥ IMMEDIATE
**Priority**: Critical - Fixes the immediate API response bug
- Fix `apiClient.unwrapResponse()` method
- Remove defensive patches
- Test API responses work correctly

### [Phase 2: Authentication Consolidation](./phase2-authentication-consolidation.md) - ðŸŽ¯ HIGH  
**Priority**: High - Eliminates architectural complexity
- Remove competing authentication systems
- Consolidate to single `useAuth` system
- Clean up redundant services

### [Phase 3: App Initialization](./phase3-app-initialization.md) - ðŸ“‹ MEDIUM
**Priority**: Medium - Fixes race conditions
- Proper dependency management between auth and data
- Fix app startup sequence
- Eliminate race conditions

### [Phase 4: Cleanup](./phase4-cleanup.md) - ðŸ§¹ LOW
**Priority**: Low - Code quality and maintenance
- Remove patches and defensive code
- Standardize patterns
- Documentation and optimization

## Progress Tracking

Use the checkboxes in each phase file to track completion. Each task should be completed and tested before moving to the next.

## Success Criteria

- âœ… No more "undefined" API responses
- âœ… Single, reliable authentication system  
- âœ… No race conditions between auth and data loading
- âœ… Clean, maintainable codebase
- âœ… All features working as expected

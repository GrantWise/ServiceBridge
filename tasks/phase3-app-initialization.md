# Phase 3: Proper App Initialization & Data Dependencies

## Priority: MEDIUM
**Goal**: Fix race conditions and ensure proper dependency management between auth and data queries

## Tasks

### Task 3.1: Fix App Initialization Flow âœ…
- [x] Ensure auth check completes before any data queries
- [x] Update App.tsx to properly sequence authentication
- [x] Add proper loading states during auth initialization
- [x] Prevent premature data fetching

### Task 3.2: Update Data Query Dependencies âœ…
- [x] Make all authenticated queries dependent on auth completion
- [x] Update React Query `enabled` conditions properly
- [x] Ensure queries don't run during auth loading state
- [x] Add proper fallback states for unauthenticated users

### Task 3.3: Fix Dashboard Metrics Dependencies âœ…
- [x] Update `useDashboardMetrics` to wait for auth completion
- [x] Remove the artificial auth state checking we added
- [x] Ensure proper query sequencing
- [x] Add loading states for dashboard data

### Task 3.4: Improve Loading States âœ…
- [x] Add proper loading indicators during auth check
- [x] Ensure smooth transition from loading to authenticated state
- [x] Handle authentication failures gracefully
- [x] Provide clear feedback to users during auth process

### Task 3.5: Test Complete App Flow ðŸ§ª
- [ ] Test fresh app load (no existing auth)
- [ ] Test app load with existing valid auth cookie
- [ ] Test app load with expired/invalid auth cookie
- [ ] Test login â†’ dashboard data loading flow
- [ ] Test logout â†’ login â†’ dashboard flow

## Success Criteria
- [x] No race conditions between auth and data queries
- [x] Clean app initialization without multiple competing auth checks
- [x] Proper loading states throughout the app
- [x] Data queries only run when appropriate
- [x] Smooth user experience from login to dashboard

# ServiceBridge Codebase Audit & Remediation Plan

*   **Audit Version:** 1.0
*   **Date:** 2025-07-01
*   **Handbook Version:** 1.0

## **Objective**

This document audits the current ServiceBridge codebase against the standards defined in the `engineering_handbook.md`. It provides a clear list of required, recommended, and suggested changes to align the project with our long-term vision, while pragmatically considering its current status as a technology demonstrator.

## **Recommendation Levels**

*   **[Required]**: Critical gap. Must be addressed for security, stability, or core architectural integrity.
*   **[Recommended]**: Important for best practices, future scalability, and maintainability. Should be addressed.
*   **[Suggested]**: "Good to have." Acceptable to omit in a PoC but should be considered for a production version.

## **Audit Findings**

### **Part 2: System Architecture**

| Requirement | Status | Findings & Context | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.1. Clean Architecture** | `Compliant` | The project correctly follows the 4-layer structure with proper dependency flow. | None. |
| **2.2. Core Backend Patterns** | `Compliant` | CQRS with MediatR, Repository Pattern, and Result Pattern are all implemented correctly. | None. |
| **2.4. Production Architecture** | `Partially Compliant` | The system uses SQLite and runs via a simple `dotnet run` command. It lacks a load balancer, Redis backplane, Hangfire, or MS SQL for production. | **[Suggested]** <br> Create a `docker-compose.production.yml` file that orchestrates the API, a new MS SQL container, and a Redis container. This is not required for the PoC but is a critical next step towards production. |

### **Part 3: Future-Proofing & SaaS Strategy**

| Requirement | Status | Findings & Context | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.2. Multi-Tenancy (`TenantId`)** | `Non-Compliant` | The core domain entities (`Product`, `AuditLog`, etc.) do not contain a `TenantId`. The EF Core `DbContext` does not have a global query filter for tenant isolation. | **[Recommended]** <br> 1. Add a `TenantId` property to the base entity class. <br> 2. Implement a placeholder `ITenantService` that returns a default tenant ID. <br> 3. Add the `HasQueryFilter` to the `DbContext`. This is a low-effort, high-impact change that prepares the data model for SaaS. |

### **Part 4: Backend Development Standards**

| Requirement | Status | Findings & Context | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4.4. Structured Logging** | `Non-Compliant` | The project uses the default .NET logger, not Serilog. The output is plain text, not structured JSON. | **[Recommended]** <br> 1. Add the `Serilog.AspNetCore` NuGet package. <br> 2. Configure Serilog in `Program.cs` to write structured JSON logs to the console. | 
| **4.4. Correlation IDs** | `Non-Compliant` | There is no middleware to create and attach a correlation ID to requests and log messages. | **[Recommended]** <br> Add a simple middleware to generate a correlation ID for each HTTP request and attach it to the Serilog `LogContext`. |

### **Part 6: Security & Compliance**

| Requirement | Status | Findings & Context | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **6.1. Authorization** | `Partially Compliant` | While `[Authorize]` attributes are present, they rely on simple role checks. The handbook requires a more robust, policy-based approach. | **[Suggested]** <br> Refactor the authorization checks to use named policies that encapsulate the roles, making the code cleaner and more maintainable. | 
| **6.2. Secret Management** | `Non-Compliant` | The JWT secret key is stored directly in `appsettings.json`. This is explicitly forbidden by the handbook. | **[Required]** <br> 1. Remove the `JwtSettings` section from `appsettings.json`. <br> 2. Use the .NET Secret Manager for local development (`dotnet user-secrets set`). <br> 3. Update `Program.cs` to load the settings from user secrets. This is a critical security best practice. |

### **Part 8: DevOps & Operations**

| Requirement | Status | Findings & Context | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **8.2. Continuous Integration** | `Non-Compliant` | The repository does not contain any CI pipeline definitions (e.g., in a `.github/workflows` directory). | **[Recommended]** <br> Create a basic `build-and-test.yml` GitHub Actions workflow that triggers on pull requests. The workflow should build the .NET solution and run all tests. |
| **8.4. Health Checks** | `Partially Compliant` | The project has a basic `/health` endpoint. However, it does not perform deep checks on its dependencies (like the database). | **[Suggested]** <br> Enhance the health check to include a connection test to the database using `AddDbContextCheck`. |

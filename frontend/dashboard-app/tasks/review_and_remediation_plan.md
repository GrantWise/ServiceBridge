# Dashboard App: Code Review and Remediation Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the findings from a review of the `dashboard-app` codebase. The application has a strong architectural foundation and has made significant progress in implementing the features required by the PRD. However, several areas require attention to meet the project's standards for testing, security, and feature completeness.

This plan details the identified issues and the necessary steps for remediation.

## 2. Critical Issues

### 2.1. Testing Coverage

*   **Issue:** The application has no test coverage. This is the most critical gap, as it violates the project's **Development Standards** and makes the application difficult to maintain and extend.
*   **Remediation:**
    1.  Create unit tests for all components, including `InventoryGrid`, `DashboardLayout`, and all pages.
    2.  Write tests for all custom hooks, such as `useProducts` and `useSignalR`.
    3.  Implement integration tests for key user flows, such as filtering the inventory grid and receiving real-time updates.

### 2.2. Security and Authorization

*   **Issue:** The `canEdit` function in `InventoryGrid.tsx` is hardcoded to `true`, allowing any user to edit products. This is a security vulnerability.
*   **Remediation:** Replace the hardcoded value with a call to the `useAuth` hook to enforce the role-based permissions defined in the **PRD**.

## 3. High-Priority Issues

### 3.1. Incomplete Feature Implementation

*   **Issue:** Several key features are present in the UI but are not functional. The code contains `// TODO` comments for:
    *   Product Editing
    *   Bulk Actions
    *   Exporting Data
*   **Remediation:** Implement the logic for these features, ensuring they meet the requirements of the **PRD**.

### 3.2. Configuration and Consistency

*   **Issue:** The ESLint configuration is in the legacy `.eslintrc.json` format.
*   **Remediation:** Migrate the configuration to an `eslint.config.js` file to align with the `scanner-app` and modern best practices.

## 4. Recommendations

The following steps are recommended to bring the `dashboard-app` up to the project's standards:

1.  **Implement Testing:** This is the highest priority. Start by adding unit tests for the `InventoryGrid` component and the `useProducts` hook.
2.  **Address Security:** Implement the role-based access control for editing products.
3.  **Complete Features:** Implement the remaining `// TODO` items to complete the application's functionality.
4.  **Unify Configuration:** Update the ESLint configuration to match the `scanner-app`.
